  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question: "What is a hackathon?"
      answer: >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question: "How much does it cost?"
      answer: >
        Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free, and we will provide meals throughout the event.
    - question: "Who can participate?"
      answer: >
        All current college, high school, and middle school students are invited to participate.
    - question: "What if I don't have coding or hackathon experience?"
      answer: >
        Beginners are especially encouraged to come! You do not need previous hackathon/coding experience or a technology
        background. CuseHacks is meant to be a comfortable learning experience for everyone. Also, there will be workshops
        and mentors available throughout the event that can help you get started.
    - question: "How do teams work?"
      answer: >
        Each team can have up to 4 members. You can come with your friends or you can form a team at the event.
        There will be team forming activities at the beginning of the hackathon for anybody interested. You can also work alone
        if you want.
    - question: "Where is the event?"
      answer: >
        The event will be held in the Life Science Building at Syracuse University.
    - question: "What is Major League Hacking?"
      answer: >
        Major League Hacking is [the official student hackathon league](https://mlh.io) in North America & Europe.
        We work with over 200 Member Events and empower over 70,000 students every year.
    - question: "Is there a code of conduct?"
      answer: >
        Yes there is. We enforce it very strongly. You can [find it here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).
